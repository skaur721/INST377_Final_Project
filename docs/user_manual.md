The movies database is created to help the user find the desired movies based on their genre. On the left-hand side, you see the genres filter. You can easily click on the button next to your favorite genre and a list of movies with that genre will pop up on the right-hand side. The results will list the movie that matches the genre and list additional information such as duration, rating, and release date. The PHP library,  MeekroDB is used to connect to the MySQL database while JQuery was used to capture the userâ€™s button options for the movies and send them to the PHP section of the code.
